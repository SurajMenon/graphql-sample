Currently the schema does not reprsent Person to Company mapping.

For this, schema change is needed : 

	type Person{
    	id: String!
		name: String!
		age: Int
		company: Company
	}
	
And a Person Resolver needs to be implemented. Like :

	@Component
	public class PersonResolver implements GraphQLResolver<Person> {
	
		//Getting company from person
		public Company getCompany(Person person) {
			return CompanyDao.INSTANCE.getCompanyById(person.getCompanyId());
		}
	}
